1. The main advantage to using setImmediate() over setTimeout() is setImmediate() will always be executed before any timers if scheduled within an I/O cycle.
2. process.nextTick() fires immediately on the same phase, while setImmediate() fires on the following iteration of the event loop.
3. In browsers, the global scope is the window object, in nodeJS, the global scope of a module is the module itself.
